## Talk Outline (REMOVE BEFORE PRESENTATION)

- Talk overview: Expanding the menu (use In-N-Out example or some other restaurant)

- Setup: Most large scale assessments measure one thing
- The utility of mutiple dimensions

- Examples where multiple dimensions may be useful
  - Math -- Word problems
  - Science -- content versus process? LOOK UP
  - Technology-enhanced items
  
- Methods for assessing multiple dimensions (with pro/cons)
  - Subscores
    - used badly
  - MIRT
  - DCMs
  
- Multiple dimensions already used in practicce
  - Testlets

- Pitfalls of approaches
  - Subscores: Used badly
  - MIRT: long tests needed
  - DCMs: No scaled score
  
- Exmaples of potential uses
  - Science example
  - Math/Reading example

## Unidimensionality...by Force?

- Most large-scale summative assessments begin with a blueprint of topics to be assessed
- The blueprint is often based on a set of standards for a given grade
- In the test construction process, test items assessing each standard are piloted
- If items do not fit the prescribed psychometric model, they are often discarded
